Notes
to run trial seg autoDiscover; choose folder for use and save folder 
getSummaryBatchScr, change rootdir and summary file , for summary data if i wanted to get it from fixed/ last SC change line #25 getSummaryInfo
get summary info: findpeaks 
definition velocity 
 plot_3Ddata(trialList_tone_on, 'aniposeData_first_sc', 'right_d2_knuckle', 200, 30000, 'A11-1', 'waterSpout');
calculate grip aperture an max grip aperture
Endpoint
        for i=1:length(trialList_tone_on(9).aniposeData_first_sc_relative)
            gripaperture(i)= right_d5_tip_r-right_d5_tip_r;
        end 
        endpoint=max(gripaperture);
Start 

for i=1:length(trialList_tone_on(9).aniposeData_first_sc
 if frames x positions > -10 
 from these pick first frame where velocity start showing and increase towards the water spout 

 cross corelation of each muscle with velocity 

 angle(cart2sphere from reach start to poistion at max speed)
