Notes
to run trial seg autoDiscover; choose folder for use and save folder 
getSummaryBatchScr, change rootdir and summary file , for summary data if i wanted to get it from fixed/ last SC change line #25 
definition velocity --> forward and backward

add check to end point for no spout contact
getSummaryInfo, currently gives
